# Digital Systems Projects

This repository contains some Digital Systems projects used for study purposes. Each project is contained in its own folder. The digital projects are implemented using Verilog and tested using Altera Quartus II and Sim-Altera.

## About Digital Systems

Digital systems are systems that work with digital signals which are discrete in nature. They form the basis of all modern electronics, including computers, mobile phones, and networking devices.

## About FPGAs

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

## About Hardware Description Languages

Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) are specialized computer languages used to describe the structure, design and operation of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits. They are used in everything from small projects to larger scale electronic infrastructure.

## About Verilog

Verilog is a type of hardware description language used for electronic design automation. It is most commonly used to design and verify digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction.

## Software Requirements

- Altera Quartus II
- Sim-Altera

## Projects

### Project 1

In the first project, we conducted a study on Verilog and the description of digital circuits. We created and tested three sub-projects in Quartus, each in a separate folder.

- In the first sub-project, we wrote a Verilog code for a 2-to-1 MUX using Behavioral description.
- In the second sub-project, we wrote a Verilog code for a 2-to-1 MUX using Data Flow description.
- In the third sub-project, we wrote a Verilog code for a 2-to-1 MUX using Structural description.

The objective was to study the behavior of tests and simulations in Quartus, and how the software interprets the same circuit described in different ways.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Altera Quartus II.
2. Compile the Verilog code.
3. Test the project using Sim-Altera.
